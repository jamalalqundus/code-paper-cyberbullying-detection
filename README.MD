# Code for the paper "Detecting cyberbullying on social networks"

This repository make available the code for data preprocessing and data generation based on the dataset provided by Noman Ashraf et al. at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507480/.

The dataset labeled cyberbullying was enhanced by manually extracting 3044 keywords and 1106 key phrases related to cyberbullying.

Using the distilbert-base-uncased language model provided by huggingface.io, cosine similarity between the keywords was calculated.

Both the code and the generated datasets are made available in this repository.

This  jupyter notbook can be used directly. All requirements are coded in the jupyter cells. We recommend using virtual environment (python3 -m venv myven)
